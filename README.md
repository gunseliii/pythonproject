# 🎮 Word Guessing Game

This project is a simple and fun command-line and graphical interface (GUI) based Python game, designed for the **Advanced Python Programming** course. To play the game, a player tries to guess a randomly selected word (from a predefined list in the code) by guessing one letter at a time. The player has a total of **6 letter guesses**. Our project was developed using **Object-Oriented Programming (OOP)** principles and **Tkinter** for the GUI.

To play the game, a Python environment must be installed on your computer, and then you can run the code we designed.
